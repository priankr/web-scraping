# web-scraping
Web scraping is used for extracting data from websites.

The process begins by inspecting the website's html and identifying the elements that contain the data we are interested in. The data can be located in different types of html elements such as div, span etc. and depending on how it is organized we approach it differently.

They Jupyter Notebook contains examples of web scraping different types of data from websites.
